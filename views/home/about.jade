p Hi! You've reached my personal web page.

  | One time in my life, I thought I wanted to be a physicist. But learning Python at the tail end of my undergrad
  | was the start of my passion for programming. So I went back to school for computer science after finding 
  | web development as an interest and went on to write a thesis for a 
  a.link(href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2379436.2379439" target="_blank") project&nbsp;
  | I completed that creates custom file system interfaces to Hadoop MapReduce.

  | As of now I'm beefing up my web development skills and enjoying Javascript every day while working at

  Closure and the expressiveness of Javascript was an eye opener for me.
  Learning Javascript, building with it and seeing where it's headed has made me a follower
  and I can't wait to see where it takes me.

  | I've got a bit of experience working with back end development. 
  a.link(href="http://nodejs.org/") Node.js&nbsp;
  | looks like my channel to return there and maybe someday take on a full stack Javascript role.
p Apart from being a husband and father, I like to stay current with the JavaScript community and learn all the things.
