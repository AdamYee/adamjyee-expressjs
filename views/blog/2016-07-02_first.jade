  I've worked in tech for about 5 years. Now at the ripe* age of 32 and feeling a little embarrassed, I write my first blog.
  There's something comforting in new beginnings. Reboot. Reset. From the ground up. It feels refreshing and inspiring. It makes you feel
  like a conqueror, yet you also feel potential. Beginning anew unlocks creativity and helps produce the right kind of dopamine.

  So here's to a new thing where I will reveal my digital self and attempt to publish meaningful, useful stuff. You can expect to read 
  about tech (probably JavaScript/Node.js)...and that's going to be it for now.
